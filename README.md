- Install [ImageMagic](https://imagemagick.org/) for your OS.

## Info
I just wanted to convert my iPhone photos to some usable format for my mother's somehow legacy computer.  
After trying some unusable offline and online tools I decided to create my own tool in Python.

How to use it? Create two directories (heic, jpg) at the script level, see in the code. Run the script.
